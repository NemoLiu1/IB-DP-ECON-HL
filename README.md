##### Types of national income
**Gross DOmestic Product (GDP)**
The measures th emoney value of all final goods and services (through the income, output, or expenditure methods) produced in a country in one year (but is often also broken in to quarerly figures).
E.g.:

**Gross Nathonal Income (GNI)**
GNI is the total income generated by a country and is calculated by adding nt property income from abroad to GDP.
GNI = GDP + net property income

***Why in our dayliy life we see GDP mentioned more than GNI?***
*GDP can give us a better understanding of a country, a better idea of the economic ability of that country. And also, when this money is being generated in domastaically, all the flow of that money are staying inside of the country.*
