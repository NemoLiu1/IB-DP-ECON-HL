#### 3.1.1
##### Measuring natinal income
Natrional income is the total value of economic activity for a country. (Measuring the size of the economy)
1. **Income method**
   The total value of income earned by house holds in the form of wages (paid to labor), interst (paid on capital), rent (paid to land owners), and prodifs (paid to exterpreneure). The does not include transfer payments (rentriemrnt/unempoyment benefits, scholarshipe) as they are not earned through economic activity.
   
2. **Output method**
   
   
3.**Expenditure method**

##### Types of national income
**Gross DOmestic Product (GDP)**
The measures th emoney value of all final goods and services (through the income, output, or expenditure methods) produced in a country in one year (but is often also broken in to quarerly figures).

**Gross Nathonal Income (GNI)**
GNI is the total income generated by a country and is calculated by adding nt property income from abroad to GDP.
GNI = GDP + net property income

***Why in our dayliy life we see GDP mentioned more than GNI?***
*GDP can give us a better understanding of a country, a better idea of the economic ability of that country. And also, when this money is being generated in domastaically, all the flow of that money are staying inside of the country.*

#### Further calculations of national income
**GNI per capita**
A measure of GNI per heading of population. This is useful for making comparisons between clj tries and for meansuring a country's economic development.

$Pressure = + Investment + All the government spending \frac{Forece}{Area}$

**Real GDP**
Adjusting for inflation allows national income figures to be effectively compared over time and measure economic growth.
E.g. 
if a country's noominal GDP incrases by 5% but thay country's inflation rate was alse 5%, the economy will not have grown during that time period.

**Economic growth and the business (trade) cycle**
**Economic growth** is defined as an increase in a country's real GDP oever time, measured by the percentage increase in real GDP oever one year.

$Growth rate = [\frac{GDP for current year - GDP for previous year}{GDP for previous year}] * 100%$

Definition of aggregate demand'
#### Aggregate Demand 

AD = consumption + investment + government spending + (exports - imports)


The aggregate demand (AD) curve

The aggregate demand curve shows the relationship between the average price level of an economy and the demand for the putput of the economy (represented by real GDP). The average price level of the exonomy is the average prce of all goods and sercices produced in an exonomy at a given proint in time.

##### Components of aggregate demand (and their determinants)
###### 1. Consumption (C) is household spending on final goods and services. Spending on intermeiate goods (mansufactureres selling goods to retailers) is not included in consumption. Consumption spending in dveloped countries accounts for around 70% of total GDP and is even higher than this in developing countries.
Determinants of consumption:
- household income: There is positivei relationship between household income and consumption (as the majority of consumer spending is on normal goods)
- interest rates: Ther is a negative relationship between intrrest reates and consumption as the cost of borrowing and return for leading lead to higher spending (lower interst rates lead to higher spending on big ticket items, less saving, and lower debt sercicing consts)
- consumer confidence: Greater consumer confidence (expectations for the fitrie health of the exconomy, income , job prospectis) can have a significant impact on current spending. Eonomistis see consumers confidence as a lending indicator for economic growth.

Components aggregate demand (and their determinants)
- The level of household indebtedness (the aount that households are borrowing) has a negative relationship with the level of consmption as income will be diverted to servicing the debt.
- The amount of ealth (cash, property, stocks, etc.) that households have is prositively related to their level of spending
- Inlftion

###### 2. Investment (I) is where respurces are allocated to produce captial goods that can build up the future productive capactity of an economy. Economists normally consider investment in terms of firms buying now plant and machinery.
Types of investment:
- Fixed investment is when firms ourchase land and machinery.
- Human investment is when firms allocate resources tp education and training to increase the productivity of labor.
- Reaserch and develeopment in investment into new products and processes.
- Social investment involes allocating resources (schools and hospital) that can inprove the furture walfare of a country's citizens.
- Infrastrocure investment means allocation resources to the major physical systems that serve a country's population (inclding energy, transport, communications, etc.)

Derenaubts of investment:
- Economic growth: Some investment wo;; be responsive to economic growth as firms incest in new capital to meet an increase in demand (especially for products will a high positive YED). This does not include pre-planned investment or replacement investment.
- Business confidence: it is which relects expectations of future revenue and profit can affect courrent incestment and is measured using the purchasing Managers index (PMI).
- Availability of funds: The availability of funds is determained by the level of savings form households in the banking system. Interest rates will alse affect the rete of investemnt that is funded through borrowing.
- corporate indebtedness: The level o f corporate indebtedness will determine the willingness of banks t lend to firms.

###### 3. Government spending (G) can account for 30-40% of GDO and can be in the form of:
- COnvering the day-to-day costs of running the public sector like the wages and salaries of public employees (current expenditure)
- investment projects for infrastucture and building public goods (capital expenditure)
- Wealfare payments such as unempliyment and housing benefits (reansfer expenditure)

Determainants of government spending:
- **Fiscal poliy** is the governemnt's ise of **taxation** tp acjoeve ecpmp,oc pnkectove omcluding exonomic growth, price stability, full emploument, and balance of payments equilibrium.
- Governments that are unable to rise enough tax revenue to meet spending plans engage in **borriwing** by selling bonds in financial markets. The **budget defircit** is the amount of borrwing over one year its accumulation is the **national debt**.
- **Political objectives** will affect spending with liberal governments more likely to spend than conservative ones.

###### 4. Net exports (X-M) is caluculated as the value of exports (X) minus the value of imports (M). Rxports are domextically produced goods and services that are sod in oeverseals markets that generated an inflow of money into the domestic economy. Inports are goods and services produces overseas and sold in domestic markets that generate and outflow of money form the domestic economy.

Determains of net exports:
- **Economic growth in overseas markets** will lead to higher demand for a country's exports as forgign households have more income to spend/ **Economic gorwth in domestic markets** will lead to higher demand for imports form overseas.
- A fall (depreciation) in the **exchange rate** (the value of the domestic currency becomes cheaper relative to other currencies) will make exports relatively cheaper and imports relitiely more expensive. A rise (appreciation) will make exports relatively more expensive and imoirts relatively cheaper.
- Countries with larger manufacturing sectors (China, Germany, Japan) will have more **trading strength** while countries with waker manufactiring sectors tend to have negative net export values.

#### Aggregate Supply

##### Defination
**Aggregate supply** is the total quantity of all goods and services the economy can produce at a given price level and at a given point in time.
It is the sum of the supply of goods and sercices from all markets in the economy.

AS(aggregate supply) is examined in two different time scales:
- The **short-run** is the time period in which the price level in the exonomy can change but the cost of factors of production is constant.
- The **long-run** is the time period in which the cost of all factoes of production can adapt to a change in the price level in the economy.

*[Note: When the averge price level in an economy changes, prices of factors of production (incomes) will not adjust automatically. The time period is not consistent over time or country.]*

#### Short-run aggregate supply (SRAS) curve
As explained by the profit motive in the model for market supply, there is a positive relationship between the average price level and the level of output that firms in an exonomy are willing and able to priduce.

##### Determaints of SRAS
- **Resources prices** (the price of inputs relationg tp production) have a significant impact on the majority of firms within a country. (ex. engergy cost like oil price)
- **Government intervention** can be in the fomr of sales or profit taxes imposed in firms or regulations (safety, enviromental, market power)
- **Government subsidies** to incentivize firms to increase output. SUbsidies to individual firms or industies are unlikely to impact SRAS, but in some cases an industry makes up a high proprtion of a country's output or impacts most or all other industies (energy, transportation).
- **Supply shocks** (ex. COVID-19, natrual disaster)

####

##### Movements of the LRAS curve (neo-classical model)
The long-run aggregate supply curve will shift if there is a change in the pitential output of the economy )an outward shift of the productio possibilities curve), LRAS will tend to increase ovwe time and is unlikely to decrease (unless auses by war, pandemic, or natural disaster).

#### Keynesian aggregate supply
##### Defination
The keynesian aggregate supply model developed by John Manynard Keynes suggests that there is no distinction between short-run and long-run.

##### Image and How to look at it
There are three model:

#### Stagflation
##### Defination
The world saw a large and fast increase in oil proces in the 1970s and late 2000s. Due to the importance of oil in production costs across industries, this caused decreases in (short-run) aggregate supply. This creatd a sperial of inflation and falling output (stagflation).

Stageflation happened when the cost of production goes up but people's income are not increasing.

#### 5 microaconomic objective
- Non-inflationary growth
- Low unemployment
- Low and stable inflation
- Equilibrium in Balance of Payments
- Fair distribution of income

##### Non-inflationary growth

##### Low unemployment
Defination for unemployment;
Unemployment is the count of jobless people in a country whi are seeking work but who do not have a job. Unemployed people need to be part of the labor force, in the labor market looking for work, and not just be people of working age who are not working.

Cauculation:
$Unemployment rate = [\frac{number of unemployment}{total labor force}] * 100%$

###### The labor force
The labor force is made up of people who are working and unempliyed, but does nor include:
- Stay-at-home parents
- People caring for rhe elderly or disabled (not as a job)
- Students
- Early retirees
- Discouraged workers (people who have given up on looking for work)

###### Measuring labor force


###### Measuring unemployment
Unemployment is difficult to measure because the labor market is constantly changing as people enter and exit the labor force. There are two ways to measure unemployment:
1. Count the total number of people in a country who are claiming unemployment benefits from the government. This number will almost always under-estimate the actual unemployment figure because many unemployed people do not claim unemployment benefits either because they are only unemployed for a short time, they do not want to apply, or they have enough wealth that they do not qualify for benefits.
2. The International Labor Organization (ILO) survey counts the number of unemployed people per household. This figure will be higher than the claimant count because it includes those who cannot or choose not to claim benefits, but it cannot cover a country’s entire population.

###### Problems with this measuring
Unemployment data is very importent to governments as an indicator of welfare in the country, but calculating an accurate number is problematic dut to:
1. The difficulty in specifically defining the labor force.
2. The under-employed (part-time or over-qualified workers who are not producting as numch economic calue as they would like)
3. Those who claim unemployment benefits are working illegally.
4. The figure does not indicate the concentration of unemployment in different
parts of the economy (ie. regions, genders, ethnic groups).


##### Low and stable inflation
Definaitions:
**Inflation** is a sustained (generally over two or more months) increase in theaverage price level of an economy.

**Disinflation** is a fall in the rate of inflation in an economy.

**Deflation** is a sustained decrease in the average price level of an economy.

**Harmonized Consumer Price Index (CPI)** is how the average price level of an economy is measured. It is a weighted index of a basket of
consumer goods (US CPI records prices of ≈80,000 items each month).

###### Problems of measuring inflation
inflation data 

###### Causes of inflation
The causes of inflation can be looked at from a demand or supply perspective. In reality, it is difficult to separate them as causes of infaltion because the factors that affect aggregate demand and aggregate supply are constantly changing. Economists often focus on periods of high inflation caused by changes either in aggregate demand or aggregate supply.

**Demand-pull inflation**
Any event that causes AD(aggregate demand) to increases can cause inflation. Periods of demand-pull inflation often lead to an inflationary ga, whiere actual output is higher than full employment output.

**Cost-push inflation**
Any event that causes costs of production across that economy to increase and SPAS to decrease can cause inflation.

Cost-push inflation can be caused by:
- Wages rising faster that output which makes avereage costs rise. This can happen when labor unions negotiate wage increases.
- Rising commodity orices (oil, wheat, rice, metals) which increase the cost of manufactured goods.
- Increases in the prices to rise, which could makes governments incease interest rates.
- Firms with significant market power adding to profits by increasing prices more than their increase in costs.

####### Constructing a weighted CPI (HL only)
1. Find goods and services that will be included in the index and categorize them accoding to type. (ex. Food; Clothing; etc.)
2. Index number are used to clculate to degee of change for prices in each category. Index numbers show that relateive change in value compated to a base year (ex: if the price of a loaf of bread in the base year is $1.20 and in folling year is $1.30, the index value would be $[[\frac{$1.30}{$1.20}]] * 100% = 108.3$)
3. Weights are assigned to each catgory representing the average percentage of household income spent on that category (ex: if an average household spends 22% of income on housing, the weighting is 22).
4. Each category of good (or service) in the price index is multiplied by its weighting. The sum of
weighted price indices divided by 100 is the weighted index.
5. The rate of inflation is calculated as the percentage change in the weighted index (ex: if the weighted
index for 2020 is 104.37 and for 2019 is 101.6, the rate of inflation is calculated as "%'.$( )"%".*
"%".* =
2.73%

##### Equilibrium in Balance of Payments
##### Fair distribution of income

#### The trade of between all these goals

#### The ways that government achieve this

##### Monetary way/policy

Central bank
It is an indepenet authority.
- It can determined the money supply.
- It sould also know exsacly how many money is out in society.
- Manage stuff with bonds.

###### Goals of monetary policy
* central bank should work with all 5 of the economic goals, however in reality, they care about "low and stable inflation" more *
Intrist rate could affect aggreagte demand, , and etc.

Monetary policy refers to a central bank's use of unterest rate and the money supply. Contral banks use monetary policy to 

1. Controlling inflation through **inflation tatgeting** (around 2-3% for development contriese, since for developing conties's ecoimy is growing, so as their inflation rate)
2. Lowering unemployment in order to boost consumption spending
3. Reducing business cycle fluctuations (shorten recessions and maintain growth periods)
4. Promoting long term growth by creating more certainty with interesr and inflation rates
      make preoducers have the ability to predict the future of intist and stuff
5. Maintaining trade balance by reducing deficits and surpluses
